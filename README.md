## Overview

This project provides a set of reinforcement learning environments for MagicLab robots, built on top of [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab).

Currently supports MagicLab **Z1-12dof** robots.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
- Install the Magiclab RL IsaacLab standalone environments.

  - Clone or copy this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MagiclabRoboticsrobotics/magiclab_rl_lab.git
    ```
  - Use a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:

    ```bash
    conda activate env_isaaclab
    ./magiclab_rl_lab.sh -i
    # restart your shell to activate the environment changes.
    ```

- Verify that the environments are correctly installed by:

  - Listing the available tasks:

    ```bash
    ./magiclab_rl_lab.sh -l # This is a faster version than isaaclab
    ```
  - Running a task:

    ```
    python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --headless --task Magiclab-Z1-12dof-Velocity
    ```
    or
    ```
    ./train_bash.sh
    ```

  - Inference with a trained agent:

    ```bash
    python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task Magiclab-Z1-12dof-Velocity
    ```

    or

    ```
    ./play_bash.sh
    ```

    if you want to use keyboard control, use:

    ```
    ./play_keyboard_bash.sh
    ```

## Deploy

After the model training is completed, we need to perform sim2sim on the trained strategy in Mujoco to test the performance of the model.
Then deploy sim2real.
